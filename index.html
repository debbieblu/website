    <h1>Rethinking The Box</h1>
    <p style="line height 1.0">
      Tiny-home designs are exciting, customizable, allowing residents to plan their personal living space, tailoring their homes to their unique needs, tastes and budget. This is a chance to have fun and actually think outside the box. Many Tiny-home builders decide to leave no stone unturned.  Building small doesn't mean you have to leave out anything.
    </p>
       Many tiny-home owners are involved in the design and building process in a hands-on way, enabling them to build practical skill sets while exercising creative independence and experiencing a sense of pride and true ownership in the tiny-home project. If taking on this project seems to overwhelming there are several companies that now build and design Tiny-homes.
     </P>
      Tiny-homes can be used as temporary or permanent living spaces. When mounted on wheels or temporary foundations, they are cheaper to build than permanent housing and offer residents the option to relocate as their needs if their circumstances change.
    </p>
      One option is if you already own land you can live in your tiny home while building the main residence. You can then rent one of the homes out to be a source of income.
    </p>
      Another factor that makes tiny homes a potentially healthy option is that they are ground-oriented, allowing residents easy access to the outside world. In contrast, studies show that living on the upper floors of a high-rise is correlated with anxiety and social isolation, as well as lower physical activity; unless of course you are a fan of stairs; behavioral problems and respiratory illnesses in children. </p>

    <h1>Sustainable Living ~ Your Way</h1>
    <p style="line height 1.0">
      You would have to have your head in the sand if you haven't heard of global warming. Did you know that most wars and disasters are linked to global warming?  We all play a role and many tiny-home enthusiasts are motivated by an environmental sustainability ethic and incorporate alternative, off-grid technologies and sustainable designs and construction practices to reduce their carbon footprint.
    <p/>
      Some tiny homes incorporate solar panels, rainwater collection and filtration systems and composting or incinerating toilets. The sky's the limit.  If you can dream it, it can be built. Smaller homes also require fewer resources and less land than larger homes, which may have significant environmental benefits.
    </p>
      Such "green" practices have the potential not only to reduce negative environmental impacts of development but also to improve our health and enhance our lives.
    </P>
       Say good-bye to mental illness and hello to mental wellness. Choose not to be a slave to your home. Building a Tiny-Home is fun! Incorporating renewable energy sources, reused building materials and contributing one's own time and skills towards the construction of a tiny home can not only lower housing costs and enable affordable home ownership but is like exercising without going to the gym.
     </p>
        Generating one's own energy needs can foster a sense of independence, self-reliance and security. Become part of wider environmental sustainability movements—feeling like we're part of the solution—can also help reduce the mental and emotional stress of environmental threats like climate change.
     </p>
        Inevitably, "tiny living" shapes an individual's relationship with physical goods, encouraging a greater awareness of waste and consumption— forcing us to reconsider how much, after all, we need in order to live a good life. Tiny living has the potential to play a key role in a longer-term cultural shift towards a more balanced life. As a society we need to re-learn what living is.

    <h1>A Big Future for Tiny Homes</h1>
    <p style="line height 1.5">
    Despite their benefits, tiny homes are not yet legal in BC. This is due in part to difficulties in regulating building codes and zoning bylaws for tiny, mobile dwellings (especially those incorporating off-grid technologies) and to negative public perception about the impact of tiny homes on the economy and health of the population. We all have a role to play in this new industry and looking forward to our futures.
  </p>
    Municipalities are starting to take steps to include this housing option in their community plans.  The City of Vancouver's "housing reset" strategy identified tiny houses as a builing industry to explore. The City of Victoria is also considering tiny houses as one option for affordable home ownership.
  </p>
    The great news is the tiny-home movement is growing from the ground up. Experts are noticing that Vancouver Island and the Sunshine coast are more open to this style of living. Across the Province, it is becoming more commonplace to find tiny homes and tiny-home communities being built under the radar, with the most passionate enthusiasts being those who live in tiny homes themselves and are invested in creating sustainable, affordable communities.
  </p>
    Together we can create a new option for living healthy. Building a healthier world for ourselves, for our children, for generations to come but also investing in our mental wellness.  Living small doesn't mean we have to give up living big.  It means we have more time to play and not be a slave to our homes.  We can do this.  We just need to think outside the box.
